# Answers for Chapter 8

1. Becouse every time the loop is executed, x is rest to the value 50 (the position of the rectangle is not updating)

2.  " rect_x " and " rect_y "  are the starting coordinates of drawing the rectangle
    " rect_change_x " and " rect_change_y " are the direction speed of rectangel 


3. at 380

4.  The following code reverses the value of the y_axis of the rectangel instead of its direction,so when 
    rect_y reaches a value greater then 450 or less than 0, the rectangle won't appear on the screen.

    if rect_y > 450 or rect_y < 0:
        rect_y = rect_y * -1
 
    correct code: 
    
    if rect_y > 450 or rect_y < 0:
        rect_change_y *= -1
 
5. First, we create two variables x and y ouside the main loop (for example x=50 and y= 50)
    then we use these two variables to draw the four parts of the figure with appropriate offset
    and at the game logic section we add one to the x to move the figure to the right (x +=1)

   

6. Becouse x and y will be generated 50 times every time the main loop is executed 
   so if we have : clock.tick(20)  then they will be generated 50 time each 20 frame pro Sec 


7. We can animate dozens of items at the same time by updating thier positions  in each frame pf our main loop

8. print(stars[1][0])

9. In the secound exaple the code directly uses the snow_list[i] as the argument for drawing the snowflakes ,
    which includes both x and y in a single list 

10. inside the loop it caculates x and y based on the current angle.
    the angle incremented by 0.03 radians during each iteration,causing the sweep to move around the circle
    and when the angle completes a full circle , it resets to 0
