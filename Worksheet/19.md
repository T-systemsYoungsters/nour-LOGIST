# Answers for Chapter 19

1. The joke plays on the idea that understanding recursion  seems circular  because
   it involves defining something in terms of itself.

2. Recursion is a concept where a function or a process calls itself repeatedly and in the case 
   of two mirrors facing each other create a recursive visual effect where each reflection contains 
   a smaller version of itself, demonstrating the property of recursion in a self-referential manner.

3. Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) uses recursion by encouraging distributors to recruit new members who, 
   in turn, recruit more members, creating a multi-level structure.

4.  In Minesweeper, when you click on an empty square, the "sweep" function reveals neighboring empty 
    squares until it reaches squares with numbers .
    We can do this by checking neighboring squares and, if they are also empty, repeating the process on those. 

5. Finding a way out of a maze using recursion is done by starting at the entrance, choosing a path, and repeating 
   this until a closed path is reached then backtrack to the most recent intersection and try a different path. 
   repeating that until we find the exit

6. The link doesn't work and I didn't understand what to do :/

7. 
   def func(n):
      if n == 1:
         return 6
      else:
         return ((1/2)*func(n-1)+4)
    
   for i in range(1,11):
      print("n= ",i ,", a= ",func(i))

8. 
   def func(n):
      if n == 1 or n == 2:
         return 1
      else:
         return (func(n-1)+func(n-2))
    
   for i in range(1,11):
      print("n= ",i ,", a= ",func(i))
