# Answers for Chapter 17

1. 
    temp = my_list[6]
    my_list[6] = my_list[7]
    my_list[7]= temp


2. 
    temp = my_list[0]
    my_list[0] = my_list[3]
    my_list[3]= temp

3. Becouse it copies the initial value of my_list[0] to my_list[1] before replacing the value
    of my_list[0] .

    temp = my_list[0]
    my_list[0] = my_list[1]
    my_list[1] = temp

8.  min_pos : It tracks the position of the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the list.

9.  cur_pos : It represents the current element being considered for sorting.

10. scan_pos : It's used to iterate through the unsorted part of the list to find the next 
    minimum element to update min_pos.

11. key_pos : It's the position of the element being considered for insertion into the sorted part of the list.
    key_value : It's the value of the element at key_pos, temporarily stored for comparison during insertion.

12. scan_pos : It's used to scan through the sorted part of the list, finding the correct 
    position for insertion by comparing elements with key_value
