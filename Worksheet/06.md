3. Because the loop will already exit when x is greater than or equal to 10 due to the condition x<10 in the while loop .
    (the condition x>=0 is inside the condition x<10 )

    (Is a countdown from 5 to 0 )

5. 
    x = float(input("Enter a number greater than zero: "))
 
    while x <= 0:
        print("Too small. Enter a number greater than zero: ")
        x = float(input("Enter a number greater than zero: "))

6.  
    x = 10
    while x > 0:
        print(x)
        x - 1
    print("Blast-off")

7. i = 0 (This line of code is not needed becouse when we don't specify in 'range', where i starts, by default it starts from zero )
   i += 1(This line of code is also not needed becouse when we don't specify in 'range', the number of the steps, the step is one by default )

8. In the first code, we have two separate loops. after the execution of the first loop, the value of x becomes ten, and then the second loop is executed
   knowing tgat x previously became 10 . therefor, we get 20 as the final value of x

   In the second code, we have nasted loop, so for each value of i, the second loop is completely executed, therefor, we get 110 as the final value of x
