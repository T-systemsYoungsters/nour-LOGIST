# Answers for Chapter 1

1. The wrong thing in this code is that, we pass the coordinates to the functionn, but we don't use them in drawing
    the shape. 
    Therefore, the shape will be drawn in the same place whatever the coordinate values. 


2. pos = pygame.mouse.get_pos()
   x = pos[0]

3. If we add code that has nothing to do with the event processing inside the event loop,that can lead to indentation errors
   and if we placed an if statment ouside the event loop , the code will work but if we have two events occurring at the same
   time, one event will be processed without the ther, and this leads to the keystrockes not being synchronized

4. It will not work to move an object using the keyboard because reversing the speed will reverse the direction of movement the 
   user wants (if the  user presses the right arrow key to move right, the object will move left)

5. becouse we don't have an exact x y location of where the keyboard is at, that's why we need to start at specific location
    and keep track of that location
