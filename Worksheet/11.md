# Answers for Chapter 2

1. By default windows hides file extension and to show it we do the following:
    -> we go to computer 
    -> then we click on 'Open Control Panel' 
    -> we search for 'folder options' and we click on it 
    -> click on 'view' tab 
    -> deselect 'Hide extensions for known file types'
    -> click 'Apply' -> click 'ok'

2.  
    Photos  : .jpg ,.png

    Graphic art : .gif 

    Uncompressed images : .bmp

    Songs and sound effects : .ogg , .mp3

    Uncompressed sounds : .wav

    
3. An image should be loaded just once so we load it before the main loop
   but we blit it inside the main loop

4. We need to use a graphics program to change the image formt.
   Changing the file extention  manually by renaming the file(from .jpg to .gif) 
   doesn't change the internal structure or the format of the file.
   The image file still incoded in the .jpg format, it just change how the operating 
   system identifies the file.


5. When we have an image in .jpg format, it subtly change the image as part of the algorithm that
    makes the image smaller. 
    Images in .png are also compressed, but the algorithms used in those formats
    do not change the image .
    so when we try to convert this .jpg image to .png format ,it does not recover 
    the lost of information from the original .jpg compression 


6. to set a background music in Pygame we do the following:

    Before the main loop :

    # load the sound :
    pygame.mixer.music.load('MIT_Concert_Choir_O_Fortuna.ogg')
    # the function (.set_endevent) used to set an event to be triggered when the music ends.
    # and (USEREVENT) is event type that will be generated when the music finishes playing
    pygame.mixer.music.set_endevent(pygame.constants.USEREVENT)
    # play the spund
    pygame.mixer.music.play()

    Inside the main loop (in the event loop):

    # check if the music finishes playing
    elif event.type == pygame.constants.USEREVENT:
    # load new song and play it
            pygame.mixer.music.load('Saito_Koji_-_01_-_Alone.ogg')
            pygame.mixer.music.play()
