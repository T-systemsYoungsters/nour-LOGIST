# Answers for Chapter 4

1. 

for i in range(10):
    print("Nour")
print("Done")
  
2. 
for i in range(20):
    print("Red")
    print("Gold")

3. 
for i in range(2,102,2):
    print(i)

4. 
i = 10
while i >= 0 :
    print(i)
    i -= 1
print("Blast off")


5. the correct program is :

print("This program takes three numbers and returns the sum.")
total = 0
 
for i in range(3):
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    total = total + x
print("The total is:", total)

6. 
import random
number = random.randrange(1,11)
print(number)

7. 
import random
number = random.random()*10+1
print(number)

8. 
sum = 0
positive = 0
negativ = 0
zeros = 0

for i in range(7):
    x=int(input("Enter a number please : "))
    sum += x

    if x == 0:
        zeros += 1
    elif x > 0:
        positive += 1
    else:
        negativ += 1

print("the total sum of numbers is = ", sum,"\nthe number of zeros  is = ",zeros,"\nthe number of positive numbers is = ",positive,"\nthe number of negative numbers is = ",negativ)

9. 
import random

num_of_heads = 0
num_of_tails = 0

for i in range(50):
    coin = random.randrange(0,2,1)
    if coin == 0:
        print("Tail")
        num_of_tails += 1
    else:
        print("Head")
        num_of_heads += 1

print("You have got ",num_of_heads," times head and ",num_of_tails,"times tail")

10. note (i uses the same numbers  "1,2,3"  for both user and computer,i think it is easier to compare)

import random

user_choice =int(input("Enter a number \n1. Rock\n2. Paper\n3. Scissors\n")) 
if user_choice != 1 and user_choice != 2 and user_choice != 3:
    user_choice =int(input("please enter 1 or 2 or 3"))

computer_choice = random.randrange(1,4,1)

if computer_choice == 1:
     print("Rock")
elif computer_choice == 2:
     print("Paper")
else:
    print("scissors")

if(computer_choice == user_choice):
    print("Draw")
elif((computer_choice == 1 and user_choice == 3) or (computer_choice == 2 and user_choice == 1) or (computer_choice == 3 and user_choice == 2)):
    print("Computer wins :( ")
else:
    print("You win :) ")
